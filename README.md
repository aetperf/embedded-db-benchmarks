# Embedded OLAP benchmarks

This project benchmarks embedded OLAP engines such as chDB and DuckDB. <br>
It runs the benchmarks as native queries against local/cloud hosted datasets.. <br>
It runs all benchmark iterations in the same session and does not reset caches. <br>

_Warning: This is far from a rigorous benchmark._
